## Detailed Status

### ‚úÖ Theorem 3: Equilibrium Exists (NEARLY COMPLETE)

**File**: `HIF1alpha/Stability.lean`

**Status**: The proof is essentially complete with only minor tactics needed.

**What works**:
- Algebraic derivation of equilibrium point
- Positivity proof structure
- Field simplification tactics

**To complete**:
```lean
-- Current proof uses:
field_simp  -- ‚úÖ Works
ring        -- ‚úÖ Works  
div_nonneg  -- ‚úÖ Works
positivity  -- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need minor adjustments
```

**Action items**:
1. Run `lake build HIF1alpha.Stability` to check compilation
2. If `positivity` tactic fails, replace with manual `apply` steps
3. Add doc comments explaining the equilibrium values
4. Consider adding lemma for uniqueness of equilibrium

**Estimated time to complete**: 1-2 hours

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Theorem 2: Boundedness (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)

**File**: `HIF1alpha/Stability.lean`

**Status**: Structure is solid; needs Gronwall's inequality application

**What works**:
- Proof outline with helper lemmas
- Bound construction using `max`
- Inequality chaining with `calc`

**What's missing**:
```lean
lemma H_bounded ... := by
  sorry  -- Need: Apply Gronwall's inequality
         -- Compare with dM/dt = k1 - k3¬∑M
         
lemma P_bounded ... := by  
  sorry  -- Need: Similar Gronwall application
```

**Required from Mathlib**:
- `Mathlib.Analysis.ODE.Gronwall.inequality`
- Possibly need to adapt interface to match our ODE structure

**Action items**:
1. Check Mathlib docs for Gronwall's inequality signature
2. Construct comparison functions explicitly
3. Prove comparison satisfies hypotheses
4. May need helper lemma about exponential bounds

**Estimated time to complete**: 4-8 hours

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Theorem 1: Existence & Uniqueness (SCAFFOLDED)

**File**: `HIF1alpha/Dynamics.lean`

**Status**: Framework in place; needs Picard-Lindel√∂f application

**What works**:
- Helper lemma structure
- Invariance statement
- Lipschitz concept

**What's missing**:
```lean
lemma vectorField_lipschitz ... := by
  sorry  -- Need: Prove polynomial is Lipschitz on compact sets
  
lemma state_space_invariant ... := by
  sorry  -- Need: Differential inequality at boundary
  
theorem solution_exists_unique ... := by
  sorry  -- Need: Apply Mathlib ODE theorem
```

**Challenges**:
- Mathlib's ODE library may not have exact theorem we need
- May need to work on intervals `[0, T]` and glue solutions
- Invariance proof requires showing boundary behavior

**Action items**:
1. Search Mathlib: `#check ODE.` then tab-complete
2. Look at `Mathlib.Analysis.ODE.PicardLindelof` examples
3. Consider proving on `[0, ‚àû)` separately from `(-‚àû, 0]`
4. Alternative: Use axiom temporarily and contribute to Mathlib

**Estimated time to complete**: 10-20 hours (or axiomatize in 30 min)

---

### ‚ùå Theorem 4: Limit Cycles (AXIOMATIZED)

**File**: `HIF1alpha/Bifurcation.lean`

**Status**: Uses axiom; not in Mathlib

**Current approach**:
```lean
axiom poincare_bendixson : ...  -- Fundamental 2D dynamics theorem
```

**What works**:
- Instability computation structure
- Parameter regime identification
- Theorem statement

**Why hard**:
- Poincar√©-Bendixson is a major theorem not in Mathlib
- Would require formalizing:
  - œâ-limit sets
  - Invariant regions
  - Jordan curve theorem
  - Index theory

**Options**:
1. **Keep axiom** (reasonable for applications)
2. **Contribute to Mathlib** (months of work, high impact)
3. **Prove for specific parameters** (numerical verification)

**Recommended**: Keep axiom, document clearly, cite classical result

**Estimated time to prove fully**: 100+ hours (major project)

---

### ‚ùå Theorem 5: Kuramoto Synchronization (SCAFFOLDED)

**File**: `HIF1alpha/Kuramoto.lean`

**Status**: Simplified version sketched

**What works**:
- Phase extraction definition
- Order parameter definition
- Simplified theorem for identical oscillators

**What's missing**:
```lean
theorem critical_coupling_exists_identical ... := by
  sorry  -- Lyapunov function approach feasible
  
theorem critical_coupling_exists ... := by
  sorry  -- Full Kuramoto theory very hard
```

**Path forward**:
1. **Start with n=2**: Prove two identical oscillators synchronize
2. **Use Lyapunov**: `V = 1 - cos(Œ∏‚ÇÇ - Œ∏‚ÇÅ)` with `dV/dt = -K sin¬≤(...)`
3. **Extend to n=3, n=4**: Build intuition
4. **General n (identical)**: Prove by induction or use symmetry

**Action items**:
1. Formalize Lyapunov function for n=2 case
2. Prove dV/dt < 0 for K > 0
3. Conclude convergence to Œ∏‚ÇÇ = Œ∏‚ÇÅ

**Estimated time (n=2 case)**: 6-12 hours

**Estimated time (general heterogeneous)**: 50+ hours or axiomatize

## Build Instructions

### Current Status
All files should compile with `sorry` and axioms:

```bash
cd HIF1alphaOscillator
lake build HIF1alpha
```

### Expected Output
- ‚úÖ No syntax errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about `sorry` (expected)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about `axiom` (expected for Theorem 4)

### Testing Individual Theorems

```bash
# Test Theorem 3 (should be closest to complete)
lake build HIF1alpha.Stability

# Test Theorem 1 & 2
lake build HIF1alpha.Dynamics

# Test Theorems 4 & 5
lake build HIF1alpha.Bifurcation
lake build HIF1alpha.Kuramoto
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Mathlib ODE Interface
**Problem**: Mathlib's ODE theorems may not match our structure exactly

**Workaround**: 
- Adapt our definitions to match Mathlib
- Or add axiom and contribute later

### Issue 2: Matrix Eigenvalues
**Problem**: Computing eigenvalues formally is tedious

**Workaround**:
- Use `sorry` for eigenvalue computations
- Or use Mathlib's spectral theory (if available)

### Issue 3: Real Analysis Limits
**Problem**: Convergence proofs need Œµ-Œ¥ definitions

**Workaround**:
- Use `Filter` library from Mathlib for limits
- Or simplify to finite-time results
