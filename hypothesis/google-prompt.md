# Google Deep Research Prompt: Completing `sorry` Statements in HIF-1α Oscillator Lean 4 Proofs

**Task Overview**:  
You are Google Deep Research, an AI specialized in deep, comprehensive research across mathematics, computer science, and formal verification. Your goal is to analyze the `sorry` statements in the Lean 4 formalization of HIF-1α oscillators (a biological model for hypoxia-inducible factor dynamics). The proofs are in [`hypothesis/proofs2.md`](../hypothesis/proofs2.md), which contains Lean 4 code with 12 `sorry` placeholders. For each `sorry`, research the required mathematical concepts, provide step-by-step derivations, suggest Lean 4 code completions using Mathlib4, and cite relevant theorems/lemmas.

**Key Requirements**:
- **Research Depth**: Draw from ODE theory, dynamical systems, bifurcation analysis, Lyapunov stability, Kuramoto synchronization, and formal methods in Lean 4/Mathlib4. Include references to papers, textbooks (e.g., Hirsch-Smale for dynamical systems), and Mathlib documentation.
- **Lean 4 Integration**: Ensure completions are syntactically correct Lean 4 code. Use tactics like `linarith`, `field_simp`, `ring`, `positivity`, and ODE-related theorems from Mathlib (e.g., `Gronwall.inequality`, `PicardLindelof`).
- **Completeness**: For each `sorry`, provide:
  1. Mathematical background and strategy.
  2. Step-by-step proof outline.
  3. Complete Lean 4 code snippet to replace `sorry`.
  4. Potential challenges and workarounds (e.g., if Mathlib lacks a theorem, suggest axioms or contributions).
  5. Verification steps (e.g., how to test in Lean).
- **Output Format**: Structure your response as a Markdown report with sections for each file/theorem. Number them as in the original (e.g., 1. Dynamics.lean - vectorField_lipschitz).
- **Assumptions**: The model is dH/dt = k1 - k2·H·P - k3·H; dP/dt = k4·H - k5·P. Parameters are positive. Focus on rigorous, formal proofs.

**List of `sorry` Statements to Complete**:

1. **Dynamics.lean - vectorField_lipschitz Lemma**: "sorry  -- Full proof: Apply lipschitzOnWith_of_locally_lipschitz with derivative bounds"
   - Context: Prove Lipschitz continuity on compact sets using derivative bounds.

2. **Dynamics.lean - state_space_invariant Lemma (H ≥ 0)**: "sorry  -- Full proof: Apply differential inequality comparison theorem"
   - Context: Show H stays non-negative using ODE comparison.

3. **Dynamics.lean - state_space_invariant Lemma (P ≥ 0)**: "sorry  -- Full proof: Similar to H case"
   - Context: Analogous for P.

4. **Dynamics.lean - solution_exists_unique Theorem**: "sorry  -- Core implementation requires: - Constructing the flow map on intervals - Proving it satisfies the ODE via deriv rules - Gluing intervals using invariance - Uniqueness via Lipschitz contraction mapping"
   - Context: Full Picard-Lindelöf proof for existence and uniqueness.

5. **Dynamics.lean - stability_criterion Theorem**: "sorry  -- Full proof requires spectral theory from Mathlib"
   - Context: Prove local stability from eigenvalue condition.

6. **Stability.lean - H_bounded Lemma**: "sorry  -- Apply Gronwall with the inequality"
   - Context: Bound H using Gronwall's inequality.

7. **Stability.lean - P_bounded Lemma**: "sorry  -- Similar to H, with M_H plugged in"
   - Context: Bound P similarly.

8. **Stability.lean - lyapunov_stability Theorem**: "sorry  -- Apply Lyapunov's theorem (axiomatize if not in Mathlib)"
   - Context: Use Lyapunov function for stability.

9. **Bifurcation.lean - equilibrium_unstable Lemma**: "sorry  -- Implement eigenvalue check using deriv rules"
   - Context: Check Jacobian eigenvalues for instability.

10. **Bifurcation.lean - limit_cycle_exists Theorem**: "sorry  -- Apply axiom with boundedness"
    - Context: Apply Poincaré-Bendixson for limit cycles.

11. **Kuramoto.lean - kuramoto_synchronization Theorem (5a)**: "sorry  -- Implement Lyapunov proof for synchronization"
    - Context: Prove sync for identical oscillators.

12. **Kuramoto.lean - kuramoto_synchronization Theorem (5b/c)**: "sorry  -- For general n, harder; start with n=2"
    - Context: General synchronization threshold.

**Additional Instructions**:
- If a proof requires new Mathlib contributions, suggest how to formalize it.
- Ensure proofs are incremental and build on existing code.
- Provide a summary at the end with overall feasibility and next steps.
- Research should be exhaustive; cite sources like "Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos" by Hirsch et al., or Mathlib docs.

**Final Output**: Deliver a complete research report in Markdown, ready for integration into the Lean project.
